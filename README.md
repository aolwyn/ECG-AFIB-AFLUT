# ECG-AFIB-AFLUT
Development of machine learning and artificial intelligence models to detect and separate atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter using ECG data.

To replicate:

<h1>Experiment 1 </h1>

- open the main.ipynb folder.
- change to your data directory.
- if testing other preproc pipeline, go to preproc and uncomment it out.
- scroll to bottom, change model.
- run


<h1> Experiment 2</h1>

- open beat_classification.py
- change data directory
- scroll to bottom, change model as needed
- run
