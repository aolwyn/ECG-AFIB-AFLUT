# ECG-AFIB-AFLUT
Development of machine learning and artificial intelligence models aimed at rhythm and beat-based detection for target classes.

Disclaimer:

- For experiment 1, we have auto-generated docstrings using a VSCode plugin. 
- Experiment 2 does not have docstrings as the functions should be self explanatory.

To replicate:
- pip install -r requirements.txt

<h1>Experiment 1 </h1>

- open the main.ipynb file.
- change to your data directory.
- if testing other preproc pipeline, go to preproc and uncomment it out.
- scroll to bottom, change model.
- run


<h1> Experiment 2</h1>

- open beat_classification.py
- change data directory
- scroll to bottom, change model as needed
- run
